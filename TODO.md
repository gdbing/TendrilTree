- update `insert` to use `parse` for large insertions and insert the complete tree @done
outliner update:
	- update leaf
		- collapsedChildren property
			- What type should it be?
				- a list of Leafs? Or a string? Or a Node subtree? Or a whole TendrilTree?
		- indentation: Int
			- starts at 0
	- add new methods
		- depth(at offset: Int)
			- returns indentation of leaf at offset
		- indent(at range: NSRange)
		- outdent(at range: NSRange)
		- collapse(at range: NSRange)
		- expand(at range: NSRange)
	- update old methods to handle indentation and collapsedChildren
		- insert
			- ensure that collapsed children are attached to last part, if newline(s) inserted into a leaf
			- inserted content should match surrounding lines (needs to be clearly defined)
		- delete
			- deleting trailing newline deletes any collapsed children
		- parse
			- content prefix tabs should be stripped and leafs should have corresponding `indentation` value
