- update `insert` to use `parse` for large insertions and insert the complete tree @done
outliner update:
	- update leaf
    - collapsedChildren: Node? // root of subtree representing hidden children
		- indentation: Int
			- starts at 0
    - add new methods
        - depth(at offset: Int) // returns indentation of leaf at offset
        - indent(depth: Int, range: NSRange)
        - collapse(at range: NSRange)
        - expand(at range: NSRange)
	- update old methods to handle indentation and collapsedChildren
		- insert
			- ensure that collapsed children are attached to last part, if newline(s) inserted into a leaf
			- inserted content should match surrounding lines (needs to be clearly defined)
		- delete
			- deleting trailing newline deletes any collapsed children
		- parse
			- content prefix tabs should be stripped and leafs should have corresponding `indentation` value
